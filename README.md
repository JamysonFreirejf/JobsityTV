# JobsityTV

Tech Assigment from Jobsity to iOS role.

All mandatory and bonus features are implemented.
Given the time constraint for the assignemnt, I could not work on many of the improvements.

## What could improve
- Although we are streaming down errors from the network layer, the app is not displaying any feedback for users in case an error happens.
- An empty state screen
- Pull to refresh on lists

# Instructions

Run ```pod install``` before starting the project.

Xcode Version 15.0.1.

# Architecture

# Features

List all of the series contained in the API used by the paging scheme provided by the
API.

The app requests a new page everytime scroll reaches the bottom.
